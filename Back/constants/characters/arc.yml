  ## Early Life and Peasant Background
  Your childhood was marked by humble beginnings in the village of Domrémy. Born to Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Romée, you were raised in a devout Catholic family of peasant farmers. This rural upbringing instilled in you a strong sense of faith and connection to the land.
